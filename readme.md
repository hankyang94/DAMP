## About
![Summary of Contributions](assets/summary.png)
 We propose **DynAMical Pose estimation (DAMP)**, the first general and practical framework to perform pose estimation from 2D and 3D visual correspondences by simulating **rigid body dynamics** arising from **virtual springs and damping** (top row, magenta lines). DAMP almost always returns the globally optimal rigid transformation across five pose estimation problems (bottom row). (a) Point cloud registration using the Bunny dataset; (b) Primitive registration using a robot model of spheres, planes, cylinders and cones; (c) Category registration using the chair category from the PASCAL3D+ dataset; (d) Absolute pose estimation (APE) using the SPEED satellite dataset; (e) Category APE using the FG3DCar dataset.
